    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviary can be installed on any OS, including Windows, Linux, and macOS (as well as integrated shells like unix on macOS or Linux through WSL on Windows). \n",
    "\n",
    "Aviary requires a working Python environment. This installation guide assumes that you already have Python installed on your system. We recommend using conda for environment management as it makes it easier to install Aviary with its full feature set, which is explained in the next section. Our recommended package manager is [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). Miniforge is an open-source alternative to miniconda, and functions identically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The minimum supported Python version is {glue:md}`python_version`; we recommend using the latest release of Python.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Detailed and Developer's installation guides assume you have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed. The Developer's Guide also assumes that if you are using your own fork of Aviary, that you have your system correctly configured with the proper permissions to pull from and push to your fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which Installation Guide Should I Use?\n",
    "The following guides are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide)\n",
    "- [Detailed Installation Guide](#detailed-guide)\n",
    "- [Developer's Guide](#developers-guide)\n",
    "- Docker Installation Guide (coming soon)\n",
    "\n",
    "The different installation guides are intended to get users of various levels of Python experience and analysis needs started. Here is a brief explanation of what can differ between Aviary installs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizers\n",
    "Aviary uses the `pyOptSparse` package to get access to a variety of different optimizers. Many of the more powerful and robust optimizers do not come with pyOptSparse by default, and may require additional steps to install. The Quick Start guide does not include pyOptSparse, however you can always \"upgrade\" your install with pyOptSparse later to get access to more optimizers. Using a conda environment can simplify that installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editable Source Code\n",
    "If you do not follow the Developer's Guide, then you will not have an editable version of Aviary source code. Following that guide installs a copy of Aviary that you can freely modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access to Development Versions\n",
    "The Quick Start Guide only grabs the most recent versioned release of Aviary, so if you need a new feature or bugfix you will have to wait until the next version release to get it. However, the other guides show how to directly get the latest Aviary code from GitHub. These development versions are generally stable and give you access to new features immediately. However, we recommend using tagged releases for studies, which makes documenting and replicating your work much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "(quick-start-guide)=\n",
    "# Quick Start Guide\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prerequisites: Python environment\n",
    "Features: Minimal Aviary install, basic optimizers only\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviary can be very quickly installed via the terminal. This version of Aviary only includes basic optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install aviary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the latest release of Aviary and all of its dependencies. This may take serval minutes. Verify your installation following [these steps](#verify-installation), and you're done! Keep in mind that some examples and most tests require optimizers that aren't included in this installation. To run those on your own machine, you will need to follow [this step](#install-pyoptsparse) from the Detailed Installation Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updating Aviary\n",
    "When a new version of Aviary is released, you can update your local copy by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --upgrade aviary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(detailed-guide)=\n",
    "# Detailed Installation Guide\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prerequisites: Python environment (conda recommended), git (optional)\n",
    "Features: Latest development version of Aviary with additional optimizers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This installation guide will show you how to install Aviary with the ability to grab latest development versions, as well as a guide on how to install `pyoptsparse` with additional optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed Aviary following the Quick Start Guide, you can \"upgrade\" your installation to use more optimizers by skipping ahead to [Step 2](#install-pyoptsparse). Once you have pyoptsparse installed, proceed to [verifying your installation](#verify-installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Install Aviary\n",
    "You can install the development version of Aviary directly from the github repository, rather than the latest tagged version from PyPi. If you don't have git, you can download the files from github, and install it using pip from inside the top-level Aviary directory (`pip install .`). If you don't want or need the latest, cutting-edge version of Aviary, installing it using the method shown in the Quick Start Guide is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary@main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Aviary\n",
    "To update your copy of Aviary to the latest development version, run this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary@main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(install-pyoptsparse)=\n",
    "## Step 2: Install pyOptSparse\n",
    "There are two sets of instructions included for pyOptSparse - read through both and determine which fits your needs and Python environment setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing with conda\n",
    "If you have a conda environment, then you can easily install pyOptSparse with access to the \"IPOPT\" optimizer. This is the most commonly used optimizer in Aviary, as it is generally more performant than \"SLSQP\" (the default option) and is available for free. First, install the `pyoptsparse` package using conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install pyoptsparse\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, add the IPOPT optimizer using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install cyipopt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing with pip, or if you have SNOPT\n",
    "To install pyOptSparse without conda, you will need the [build_pyoptsparse](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/build_pyoptsparse) package to help build pyOptSparse correctly. It is possible to install pyOptSparse without this utility package, but that is outside the scope of this guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "First install `build_pyoptsparse`, then run it as a command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/OpenMDAO/build_pyoptsparse\n",
    "build_pyoptsparse\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding SNOPT\n",
    "[SNOPT](http://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) is a proprietary, high-performance optimizer that is very good at solving large nonlinear problems and is used by many OpenMDAO users. SNOPT is only supported on Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a copy of SNOPT, instead run the following command to install `pyoptsparse` with both IPOPT and SNOPT available:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "build_pyoptsparse -s /path_to_SNOPT_dir\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Troubleshooting\n",
    "Here are steps to resolve some common errors seen when installing pyOptSparse. First, try running `build_pyoptsparse -v` to get a more verbose output.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you see an error for a missing command:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "ERROR: Required command swig not found.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Install the missing package (in this case `swig`) using pip or conda. Swig is a commonly missing dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you see an error where a conda or mamba command failed:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['mamba', 'info', '--unsafe-channels']' returned non-zero exit status 109.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run `build_pyoptsparse -m` to disable use of mamba commands during installation. Adding `-e` will do the same for conda if your error specifically mentions `'conda'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(developers-guide)=\n",
    "# Developer's Guide\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prerequisites: Python environment (conda recommended), git\n",
    "Features: Editable install of latest version Aviary with additional optimizers, additional packages for development and testing\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Developer's Guide installs an editable version of Aviary source code, cloned from github, as well as additional Python packages needed for Aviary development and contributing code to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Install Aviary\n",
    " It is recommended for developers to create their own fork of Aviary and clone that. In these instructions we will use the main [github repository](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary), if you are using a fork simply substitute the url with your own. Navigate to the folder where you'd like Aviary to be downloaded to, then run:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will install Aviary in \"editable\" mode, which means that you can make changes to the code inside this Aviary directory. The `[all]` tag will also install all optional dependencies - Aviary has several installation configurations you can use by adding the correct tag inside brackets after the period. The available tags are detailed [here](#optional-dependencies). From inside the top-level Aviary directory (it should contain a file called `pyproject.toml`), run:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Aviary\n",
    "To update your copy of Aviary to the latest development version, run this command from anywhere inside the Aviary repository folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Install pyOptSparse\n",

    "- *testflo*\n",
    "- *ambiance*\n",
    "- *openaerostruct*\n",
    "\n",
    "`testflo` is the core package that automates testing. The other two packages, `ambiance` and `openaerostruct`, are needed to run example cases that incorporate them as external subsystems. It is useful to be able to run these cases even if you have no interest in those specific tools to ensure that the interface for external subsystems is working correctly.\n",
