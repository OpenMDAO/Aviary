    "Currently, there are a couple of examples: `battery` and `simple_weight`. Let us take a look at `simple_weight` first. As shown in this example, this is a simplified example of a component that computes a weight for the wing and horizontal tail. It does not provide realistic computations but rough estimates to `Aircraft.Wing.MASS` and `Aircraft.HorizontalTail.MASS`. When this external subsystem is added to your pre-mission phase, Aviary will compute these weights in its core subsystem as usual, but then the wing mass and tail mass values will be overridden by this external subsytem.\n",
