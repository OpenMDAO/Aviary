# What Next?

Now that you have a working copy of Aviary and a rough idea of what the code does, you have several places to continue reading.
You can follow along with the [examples](../examples/examples.md), which slowly ramp up in complexity, to see Aviary in action.

The User Guide documents Aviary's many features and gives a good working knowledge of the code.
The [Fundamentals](../user_guide/aviary_fundamentals.md) page an excellent place to start.
