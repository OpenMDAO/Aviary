    "The input `.csv` file defines the aircraft and mission. In an Aviary input file you see a list of Aviary variables, their values, and units. Aviary variables are colon delimited strings (e.g. `aircraft:wing:aspect_ratio`). An Aviary variable name usually has three words. The first word is `aircraft` or `mission`, the second word is a subsystem name and the third is the variable name. Each variable has a value and units. Aviary requires units for every variable because it reduces errors and is a good engineering practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you have used the {glue:md}`fortran_to_aviary` tool to create a `.csv` file you must check the outputted variable values and units to ensure the file is valid and what you expect.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that some variables do not follow the standard naming format (e.g. {glue:md}`climb_range`). These are used for the initial guessing of the trajectory. They are intentionally separate to prevent conflicts with some similarly named variables. They are only used once to set up the problem and then are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we see a list of `GASP` variables that are not converted. Not all variables are converted to Aviary right now. They may represent some features in `FLOPS` and `GASP` that we haven't implemented in Aviary yet.\n",

    "To find information about a variable (e.g. description, data type, etc.), users should read the [Variable Metadata Doc](../user_guide/variable_metadata).\n",

For example, variable `aircraft:wing:aspect_ratio` in {glue:md}`aircraft_for_bench_GwGm.csv` is mapped to{glue:md}`Aircraft.Wing.ASPECT_RATIO` in `aviary/variable_info/variable_meta_data.py`. So, the first part (e.g., `aircraft` or `mission`) is mapped to the same word but with the first letter capitalized (e.g., `Aircraft` or `Mission`). The third word is all caps (e.g., `ASPECT_RATIO`). The middle part (e.g., `wing`) is a little more complicated. In most cases, this part capitalizes the first letter (e.g., `Wing`). The following words have special mappings:\n",
