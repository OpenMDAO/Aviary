Here, {glue:md}`time_duration_bounds` is a tuple of (lower, upper) bounds for the duration of the integration variable across the phase and {glue:md}`time_duration_ref` is the unit-reference value for the duration of the integration variable across the phase (see [Dymos Variables](https://openmdao.github.io/dymos/features/phases/variables.html)). This implies a time range of {glue:md}`time_duration_bounds_relative` in {glue:md}`groundroll` phase, or:\n",

    "Comparing to `velocity` and `distance`, `mass` is not scaled to the same range. This is okay because aircraft mass is actually a constant in this phase. A huge upper bound will not have an impact.\n",
