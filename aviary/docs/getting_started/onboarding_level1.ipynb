Defect is a residual that measures how accurately the proposed state and control history obeyed the ODE governing the system dynamics. For distance, the defect reference is `100` ft. For `TAS`, `defect_ref` is not provided. The default behavior is to make make the `defect_ref` equal to the `ref` value.
