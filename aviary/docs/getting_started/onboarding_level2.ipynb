    "In Level 2, we see more flexibility and additional choices. You will be exposed to some simple Python code and see how Aviary establishes a problem from beginning to end. Each step is built upon the capabilities of [Level 3](onboarding_level3). Users will be led to Level 3 in a natural way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 2 is defined in the [aviary/interface/methods_for_level1.py file](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/blob/main/aviary/interface/methods_for_level1.py) and it has a single method `run_aviary()` with a few arguments. If you examine `interface/level1.py` you see that Level 1 prepares those arguments and then call `run_aviary()`. For `aviary run_mission aircraft_for_bench_GwGm` examples, those arguments are:\n",

    "All the above arguments are straightforward except `objective_type`. Even though `objective_type` is `None`, it is not treated as `None`. In this scenario, the objective is set based on `problem_type` when using the GASP-based mission method, but not the FLOPS-based mission. There are three options for `problem_type`.

As you can see, since `problem_type` is `SIZING` by default in our case and we don't manually alter this setting, Aviary set objective to `Mission.Objectives.FUEL`. We will discuss more options of `objective_type` later on.\n",

    "This is because if we just minimized fuel burn then the optimizer would probably fly the plane slowly to save fuel, but we actually care about some mix of minimizing fuel burn while providing a reasonable travel time for the passengers. This leads to the `hybrid_objective` which seeks to minimize a combination of those two objectives. `final_time` is the duration of the full mission and is usually in the range of hours. So, the denominator `5.` means `5 hours`. That's just a value to scale the final_time variable. Since it's a composite objective we didn't want to have OpenMDAO do the scaling because the two variables in the objective are of a different order of magnitude. We will show an example of this objective type in level 2 discussion.\n",
