# Welcome to Aviary
[Aviary](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary) is an aircraft analysis, design, and optimization tool built on top of the Python-based optimization framework [OpenMDAO](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO).
Aviary provides a flexible and user-friendly optimization platform for conceptual aircraft design. 

```{Note}
Aviary is under active development!
While the base features of the code are relatively stable, new releases may make changes that require users on the bleeding-edge to update their models.
