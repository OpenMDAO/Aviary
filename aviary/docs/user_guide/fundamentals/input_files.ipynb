    "# Aviary Input Files\n",
    "Aviary has two main kinds of inputs: aircraft definition, and mission definition.\n",
    "Both of these inputs can be provided to Aviary in the form of a file, or directly defined in Python if you are using Aviary as part of a Python script.\n",
    "This page will explain what the file-based forms of these input files look like, and how to define them in Python will be covered later.<!-- TODO: name and directly link to this guide once complete -->.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"mission definition\" input describes in detail what the mission profile will look like, and information Dymos needs to set up and solve that trajectory. This data always takes the form of a Python dictionary - when calling Aviary without using a Python script, such as from the command line, a file containing this dictionary can be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aircraft Definition File\n",
    "\"Aircraft definition\" includes all the information needed about the aircraft, such as known physical properties, and also some information needed to set up the Aviary problem. This file takes the form of a comma-separated-values (.csv) file, with columns for variable name, value, and units. If a variable is unitless, then the units column is optional, or \"unitless\" can be specified for clarity.\n",
