    "\n",
    "```note\n",
    "The aircraft definition provides the values of inputs to your Aviary problem, or initial conditions of design variables. If you specify a variable that is a output of an internal calculation, it typically becomes an override<!-- TODO: link to overriding doc page -->.\n",

If your variable requires a list (or other iterable like a numpy array, tuple, etc.) provide each individual item in the array as it's own column in the csv file, like so:\n",

Other than following the requirements for that data object, there are no additional steps needed to set up your inputs in this way."
