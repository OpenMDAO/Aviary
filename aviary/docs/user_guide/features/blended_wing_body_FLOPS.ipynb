    "### Fuselage Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options: simple layout and detailed layout. For simple layout, you are given fuselage length, width and leading edge angle (as well as the rear spar percent chord at fuselage centerline, default to 70%), Aviary computes passenger compartment length, wing root chord, cabin area. This is shown in the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fuselage size](../images/BWB_FLOPS_Fuselage_Simple_Geom.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable `Rear_spar_percent_chord` serves as the ratio of fuselage length and compartment length. It says that the rear spar is mounted at the side of fuselage which is 70% (default) of fuselage length from the leading edge. `Rear_spar_percent_chord` is hard coded for now, but can be easily converted to an Aviary variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed layout involves more details like the number of passengers, seat pitch and seat abreast. Fuselage length and width are no longer inputs but outputs. If you have those data, it is a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For BWB, there is a new concept: the number of passenger cabin bays (or `Aircraft.BWB.NUM_BAYS`). It is a discrete, pressurized structural compartment within the BWB center body that contains passenger seating and is bounded by primary load-carrying frames, ribs, and pressure bulkheads. In Aviary, we determine the number of bays as how many blocks can be fit within the fuselage cabin width, assuming each block has 12 feets width (hard coded but can be converted to an Aviary option). Note that it is not a layout term and bays are not separated by aisles even though the number of bays is computed here in fuselage layout components. The following is an example of three bay sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fuselage size](../images/BWB_FLOPS_fuselage_3_Bays.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, fuselage height is computed from the width and height-to-width ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose detailed layout or simple layout, the user can set up a flag `Aircraft.Fuselage.SIMPLE_LAYOUT`. If it is true, Aviary assumes a simple layout. Otherwise, it is a detailed layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Wings\n",
    "\n",
    "For BWB, there are always detailed wings. They are either given (BWBUpdateDetailedWingDist) or created (BWBComputeDetailedWingDist). This means that number of input wing stations is always positive. If input wing stations are not provided, FLOPS adds three points. We call this case the simple wing case. Otherwise, we say that we have a detailed wing case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the detailed wing data is given. That means we are given the following arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Aircraft.Wing.INPUT_STATION_DIST` - the input station distribution (an Aviary option)\n",
    "- `Aircraft.Wing.CHORD_PER_SEMISPAN_DIST`\n",
    "- `Aircraft.Wing.THICKNESS_TO_CHORD_DIST`\n",
    "- `Aircraft.Wing.LOAD_PATH_SWEEP_DIST`\n",
    "\n",
    "These data are used to define an outboard wing panel to be added to the side of the cabin. In FLOPS, data start from the wing root to the wing tip. For transporter aircraft, it is good enough. But for BWB aircraft, we need to add one additional wing station at the body centerline. So, if you obtain the data from a FLOPS data set. You need to one entry at the beginning of the lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Aircraft.Wing.INPUT_STATION_DIST` is the input station distribution (an Aviary option). Each entry is a location of an input station, either as a fraction from wing root to wing tip (when value < 1.0), or the absolute location. If you obtain the data from a FLOPS input data, add a 0.0 at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Aircraft.Wing.CHORD_PER_SEMISPAN_DIST` is the chord length, either as a fraction of semispan or actual chord. If you obtain the data from a FLOPS input data, add a -1.0 at the beginning. It will be updated during the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Aircraft.Wing.THICKNESS_TO_CHORD_DIST` is the thickness to chord ratios at the input station distribution. If you obtain the data from a FLOPS input data, add a -1.0 at the beginning. It will be updated during the run.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Aircraft.Wing.LOAD_PATH_SWEEP_DIST` is the load path sweep angle between two adjacent input station. f you obtain the data from a FLOPS input data, add a 0.0 at the beginning. Note that this list should have one fewer entry than the other three lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Wings\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the BWB aircraft always have detailed wings, but users do not have to provide the data as above. In this case, the user should provide (0.0, 0.5, 1.0) as `Aircraft.Wing.INPUT_STATION_DIST`. When Aviary runs, the above input variables are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fuselage and Wing\n",
    "\n",
    "As a summary, the geometry subsystem for BWB is very similar to that of transporter aircraft. See the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fuselage size](../images/BWB_FLOPS_geom.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose between simple fuselage layout or detailed fuselage layout, the user sets `Aircraft.Fuselage.SIMPLE_LAYOUT` to True or False. For BWB, to choose between providing detailed wing or letting Aviary to create a detailed wing, the user sets `Aircraft.BWB.DETAILED_WING_PROVIDED` to True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the two cases, we see that `BWBComputeDetailedWingDist` and `BWBUpdateDetailedWingDist` are new. This is because we must update `Aircraft.Wing.CHORD_PER_SEMISPAN_DIST`, `Aircraft.Wing.THICKNESS_TO_CHORD_DIST`, and `Aircraft.Wing.LOAD_PATH_SWEEP_DIST`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is explained in the following diagram (in the case of detailed wing provided):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fuselage size](../images/BWB_FLOPS_Geom_fus_wing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fuselage Cross Section and Wetted Area\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the nature of blended wing body, we ignore the fuselage wetted area. There,\n",
    "\n",
    "`Aircraft.Fuselage.CROSS_SECTION = 0.0`\n",
    "`Aircraft.Fuselage.WETTED_AREA = 0.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented in `_BWBFuselage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The FLOPS based BWB aircraft does not have horizontal and vertical tails. We simply set \n",
    "\n",
    "`Aircraft.HorizontalTail.CHARACTERISTIC_LENGTH = 0.0`\n",
    "`Aircraft.VerticalTail.CHARACTERISTIC_LENGTH = 0.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the FLOPS algorithm does not apply to non-horizontal and non-vertical tails scenarios. If the user want to add them, their mass equations must be provided separately. See `HorizontalTailCharacteristicLength` and `VerticalTailCharacteristicLength` classes for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FLOPS Based Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviary computes masses of indiviual components. For BWB, most of them share the same code with transporters. There are a few exceptions. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BWBFurnishingsGroupMass` (computation of `Aircraft.Furnishings.MASS`)\n",
    "- `BWBFuselageMass` (computation of `Aircraft.Fuselage.MASS`)\n",
    "- `BWBAftBodyMass` (computation of `Aircraft.Wing.BWB_AFTBODY_MASS`)\n",
    "- `BWBWingMiscMass` (computation of `Aircraft.Wing.MISC_MASS`)\n",
    "- `BWBDetailedWingBendingFact` (computation of `Aircraft.Wing.BENDING_MATERIAL_FACTOR`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `BWBAftBodyMass` is a new component for BWB. This area starts from the rear span and backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the wing is always a detailed wing for BWB aircraft, we must compute the wing bending material factor with sweep adjustment. This is done in `BWBDetailedWingBendingFact`."
