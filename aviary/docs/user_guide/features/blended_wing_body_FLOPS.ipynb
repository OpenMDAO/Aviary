It is a discrete, pressurized structural compartment within the BWB center body that contains passenger seating and is bounded by primary load-carrying frames, ribs, and pressure bulkheads. In Aviary, we determine the number of bays as how many blocks can be fit within the fuselage cabin width, assuming each block has a 12-foot width (hard coded). Note that it is not a layout term and bays are not separated by aisles even though the number of bays is computed here in fuselage layout components. The following is an example of six bays.\n",

Here, `Aircraft.Wing.INPUT_STATION_DIST[0] = 0.0` means that the first station is at the fuselage center line （at 0.0%). `Aircraft.Wing.INPUT_STATION_DIST[2] = 1.0` means that the last station is at the tip (namely 100% place). `Aircraft.Wing.INPUT_STATION_DIST[1] = 0.5` is a temporary place holder. When Aviary runs, `Aircraft.Wing.INPUT_STATION_DIST[1]` is updated to the location of root chord (note that this is the actual location, not the percentage). The same three local variables  `BWB_THICKNESS_TO_CHORD_DIST` (dimension 3), {glue:md}`BWB_THICKNESS_TO_CHORD_DIST` (dimension 3), and {glue:md}`BWB_LOAD_PATH_SWEEP_DIST` (dimension 2) are updated accordingly.
