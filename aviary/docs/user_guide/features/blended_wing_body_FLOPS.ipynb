To model a special model, the user must read this document carefully to see it is within the scope of the Aviary implementation.\n",

    "## FLOPS Based Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "The FLOPS based geometry subsystems are shown in the following table. The left column is for the conventional aircraft and the right column is for BWB aircraft. In both case, user can choose a simple layout or a detailed layout.\n",
