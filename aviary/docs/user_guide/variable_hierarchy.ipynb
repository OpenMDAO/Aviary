    "# Understanding the Variable Hierarchy\n",
    "## How Variable Hierarchies Work\n",
    "Aircraft models in Aviary usually consist of hundreds of different variables representing different aspects of the physical aircraft, behavior of the model, behavior of the mission, etc. Managing and properly connecting all those variables requires a simple framework within which we can interact with several variables at once. The idea of variable hierarchies meets this need for a simple variable framework and breaks all the variables of a model up into smaller controllable categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variable hierarchy itself is rather simple. The variables are broken up into separate high level categories and each category becomes its own top-level class. Within that class we create \"inner classes\" (classes which are an attribute of a higher level class) that encompass a more specific category. If needed, secondary inner classes within an inner class may be created, and so on until the desired detail depth is achieved. However, too many layers down and the tedium will outweigh any value gained through specificity. \n",
    "\n",
    "These classes and inner classes are not used for any sort of complex coding functionality. Instead they simply serve to house model variables themselves. Each class and inner class can have variables assigned to it (in object-oriented speak, the variables become an attribute of the class or inner class), and each variable assigned to a class or inner class corresponds 1-to-1 with a variable needed for the model. The variables in each class are really just identifiers that point to the actual variable name in the model. The value assigned to each variable in the classes is a string that is the name of that variable in the actual model. That string is the variable name that OpenMDAO will see, despite the fact that the user will rarely call the variable by that name. Instead the user will refer to a variable name by its hierarchy variable (eg. referring to `'aircraft:wing:span'` as `Aircraft.Wing.SPAN`) to make it easier to autofill the variable and also to allow more uniform and controlled access to the variable names themselves.\n",

    "## The Aviary-core Variable Hierarchies\n",
    "While the idea of a variable hierarchy can be created and used on its own, Aviary-core provides two specific variable hierarchies that are necessary for Aviary-core systems and which follow both the rules of convention and the rules of programmatic necessity laid out above. The two hierarchies provided by Aviary-core are `Aircraft` and `Mission`. `Aircraft` houses all variables that have to do with physical aspects of the aircraft, as well as all variables that do not affect the mission or change in time. This includes several variables that are options in the model instead of inputs or outputs. `Mission` on the other hand houses all variables that reference the mission or change in time. This includes things such as `Mission.Design.CRUISE_ALTITUDE` and `Mission.Design.RANGE` as well as things such as objectives for the optimization, parameters at various phases of flight, etc. The `Aircraft` and `Mission` hierarchies are the only hierarchies provided by Aviary-core, and they are both necessary for the successful running of various Aviary subsystems. Whatever additional or extended variable hierarchies have been created by the user, the end hierarchy *must* include the variables from the `Aircraft` and `Mission` hierarchies in the Aviary core, and these variables must not be altered. We offer more information below on extending and merging together variable hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete list of the variables included in the Aviary-core hierarchy visit the [Variable Metadata doc page](../user_guide/variable_metadata.ipynb). The hierarchies themselves are located [here](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/blob/main/aviary/variable_info/variables.py) in the repository and can be accessed in this way:"

    "## Conventions and Requirements of the Variable Hierarchies\n",
    "There are some conventions surrounding the variable hierarchy that are required, and other things that are purely convention. Below is a list of the programmatically required aspects of the variable hierarchy:\n",
    "- Avoiding periods in the string-valued variable names is a must. Periods that are included here will end up as periods in an OpenMDAO variable name which will throw an error.\n",
    "- Including a colon after the first word in the string-valued variable name is also a must. The expressions `promotes=[\"aircraft:*\"]` and `promotes=[\"mission:*\"]` appear frequently within Aviary, and if these colons are not included variables will not get properly connected, leading to hard-to-detect errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, other things are merely convention that the Aviary team follows. Below is a list of the conventions that are *not* programmatically required:\n",
    "- Inner classes and variables are all organized alphabetically within a hierarchy. This is optional, but we follow this convention within the Aviary-core variable hierarchy to preserve cleanliness.\n",
    "- All variables in the hierarchy have a depth of 3. This is optional, but again we follow this convention within the Aviary-core variable hierarchy to preserve cleanliness and uniformity of code.\n",
    "- Including colons after all words in the string-valued variable name is optional. As stated above, it is a must after the first word for use in promotion statements, but after that it is purely a choice of convention to preserve clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is prudent at this point to pause and explain what is meant by *hierarchy type*. This is not a technical coding in term, instead *type* is an explanatory term that we use to describe the classification of a hierarchy. A hierarchy's type is its high level category. For example, a hierarchy of the `Aircraft` type would be a hierarchy that houses the variables that have to do with the physical aspects of an aircraft, and a hierarchy of the `Mission` type would be a hierarchy that houses the variables which reference the mission or change in time. These are the only two types of hierarchies that are provided in Aviary-core, however, other types are possible, such as a `Fleet` type hierarchy describing the variables that affect an entire fleet of aircraft, an `AirTrafficControl` type hierarchy describing all the variables having to do with air traffic control, etc. The concept of the `Aircraft` and `Mission` type hierarchies will be used throughout the rest of this article.\n",

    "## Building Your Own Hierarchy\n",
    "The Aviary-core provides the pre-built variable hierarchies listed above. However, for the user that would like to add external subsystems to Aviary, the variables in the Aviary-core hierarchies may not be sufficient. In this case, there are three options: 1) extend the existing variable hierarchies from Aviary-core, 2) create your own variable hierarchies and merge them with the existing hierarchies from Aviary-core, 3) do a combination of #1 and #2. Extending a creating your own variable hierarchies are addressed below.\n",

    "### Extend the Existing Aviary-core Hierarchies\n",
    "If you are just adding one external subsystem to an Aviary-core model, or if you are adding multiple subsystems all being developed in the same location by the same person, our suggested path is to create one extension of the Aviary-core hierarchies. The method to extend the Aviary-core variable hierarchies is to subclass those hierarchies (which preserves all the data from the original hierarchies) and add your own additional variables as necessary. To take a simple example, let's say we wanted to add a little bit of detail to the existing `Aircraft` variable hierarchy for our external subsystem. The detail we would like to add is some information about the flaps on the wing as well as a jury strut and a center of gravity location. We would extend the existing variable hierarchy using the following code:"

    "There are a few things to notice about this code. The first is that, unlike the Aviary-core `Aircraft` variable hierarchy, this hierarchy has variables with a depth of two and a depth of four. When we extend the Aviary-core variable hierarchies we are not restricted to the depth of three that the core hierarchies have. The second thing to notice is that when we extend an inner class that already exists in the Aviary-core hierarchy (`Wing`) we subclass the inner class from the Aviary-core so that we can preserve all the information from that Aviary-core inner class. However, in the case of the inner class `Jury` which does not already exist in the Aviary-core hierarchy, there is nothing to subclass, and thus that inner class stands on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "When extending the Aviary-core variable hierarchies, you can create one extension of each type of hierarchy, or you can create multiple extensions of each type which will eventually be merged together. If you are developing only one external subsystem or all your subsystems are being developed in the same place by the same person, one extension of each Aviary-core hierarchy should suffice. However, if you have multiple developers working on different subsystems in different locations, each developer may want to create their own extension. To aid in this case, Aviary provides the capability to merge together multiple hierarchies of the same type into one hierarchy of that type. More information on this capability is shown at the bottom of this page.\n",

An example of this might be if you are doing fleet-level analyses and would like a `Fleet` variable hierarchy.\n",
