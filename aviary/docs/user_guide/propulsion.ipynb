    "# Propulsion\n",
    "\n",
    "The propulsion subsystem in Aviary organizes and executes models for engine sizing and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviary does not natively model gas-turbine performance, and instead relies on user-provided data and/or custom performance models to perform propulsion analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviary supports an arbitrary number of propulsor models on a vehicle, each with their own unique properties such as performance characteristics, scaling behaviors, and number of propulsors for that given type. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In Aviary, when we refer to multiple engines of the same type, we say they are homogenous. When you are dealing with multiple engines of different types, we say they are heterogeneous.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- A diagram would be helpful here, showing X propulsors of type A and Y propulsors of type B on an outline of an aircraft -->\n",
    "Each unique type of engine is defined by a *engine model*<!-- Link to wherever this class is described - theory guide? -->. In Aviary, an *engine model* contains information on how to size and estimate performance for a single instance of an engine of that type. During analysis, Aviary handles summing performance data to a system level. This way, information is available on the performance of both a single instance of an engine, as well as aircraft-level totals, for other Aviary subsystems to utilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviary's variable hierarchy makes a distinction between variables that apply to a single instance of an engine, under the `Aircraft.Engine` sub-category, and variables that apply to the propulsion system as a whole under `Aircraft.Propulsion`. As an example, imagine an aircraft with a heterogeneous set of engines (those with unique properties). Maximum sea-level-static thrust would be defined differently per engine vs propulsion system like so:\n",
    "\n",
    ">*aircraft:engine:scaled_sls_thrust = [1500, 2200], lbf*\n",
    ">\n",
    ">*aircraft:engine:num_engines = [3, 2], unitless*\n",
    ">\n",
    ">*aircraft:propulsion:total_scaled_sls_thrust = 8900, lbf*\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, variables under *engine* are vectors that store a value for a single each instance of a single type of engine, while variables under *propulsion* only store a single value that is relevant to the entire aircraft rather than any one specific engine or set of engines. Put another way, this aircraft has two hereogenous types of engines, the first that produces 1,500 lbf of thrust *per engine*, with three of those engines on the aircraft, and the second engine that produces 2,200 lbf of thrust *per engine* with only two copies of that engine on the aircraft. The propulsion-level total is 8,900 lbf of thrust, which is every engine physically present on the aircraft combined together (1500\\*3 + 2200\\*2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the user does not need to define *propulsion* variables, as Aviary can calculate them given values in *engine*, but they are important to understand when reading results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explain how to set up the propulsion systems of an Aviary model, focusing on relatively straightforward aircraft configurations."

    "## Engine Decks\n",
    "<!--parts of this are probably theory?-->\n",
    "The primary way Aviary handles engine performance is by interpolating tabular data from a user-defined file that describes performance characteristics for a given engine. Engines modeled in this manner are called *engine decks*<!-- Link to wherever this class is described - theory guide? -->. Engine decks are a type of engine model - they use the same basic interface, but have additional functionality to handle reading and processing data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engine decks can contain a variety of different data to represent any number of propulsion systems, typically ones that utilize combustion such as turbofan or turboshaft engines, including hybridized ones. The most common application of an *engine deck* is to represent a turbofan engine, essentially as black box model that describes the relationship between energy consuption (in the form of fuel) into useful work (the production of thrust).\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced applications of *engine decks* are as parts of larger, more detailed *engine models*, such as a turboprop. A turboprop model, as described later, connects a turboshaft engine deck with a gearbox and propeller model to bridge the gap between energy consumption and thrust production, packaged together into a single model that treated as a singular unit by the greater propulsion system."

A variety of alternate names for these variables are understood by Aviary, but it is recommended to use the official names given here.
