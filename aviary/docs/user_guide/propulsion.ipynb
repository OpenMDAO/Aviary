In Aviary, an engine model contains information on how to size and estimate performance for a single instance of an engine of that type.

A variety of alternate names for these variables are understood by Aviary, but it is recommended to use the official names given here.

Anything after this symbol on that line is ignored by Aviary, allowing the user to temporarily remove data points or add in-line comments with context for the data. It is good practice to include comments at the start of the file to explain what kind of engine the data represents, and where it came from."
