    "# Creating a Turboprop Powered Aircraft Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will create an aircraft using a more advanced `EngineModel`, the `TurbopropModel`. This is a more complicated type of engine that combines several different models into a single unit. The `TurbopropModel` has three individual pieces needed to create it - a \"shaft power model\" that describes how the turboprop turns energy into shaft power, such as a turboshaft or motor, a \"gearbox model\" for adjusting the shaft RPM, and a \"propeller model\" to convert shaft power into thrust. Let's walk through two examples: first building a turboprop-powered aircraft with a minimum amount of information, and then a second example where we electrify the aircraft by replacing the default models in the `TurbopropModel` with custom ones.\n",
