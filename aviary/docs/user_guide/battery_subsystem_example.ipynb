    "The output is a bit verbose, but tells you which methods are incorrect and why.\n",
    "For example, here the `get_states` method returned a dict that included a key (`'amps'`) with a value of 6 instead of being a dictionary as expected.\n",
    "In the `get_constraints` method, a constraint was added to the dictionary but did not include a `type` key, which is required as stated by the error message.\n",

    "If you encounter an error when using your subsystem, but the test here did not find it, please let the Aviary dev team know!\n",
    "We'd love to hear from you on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/issues) so we can help everyone write great external subsystems."
