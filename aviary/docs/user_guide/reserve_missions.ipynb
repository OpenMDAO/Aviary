    "\n",
    "* {glue:md}`height_energy`\n",
    "* {glue:md}`2DOF`\n",
    "\n",
    "A reserve mission can be created by appending one or more reserve phases to {glue:md}`mission_info` after the last phase of the regular mission.\n",
    "To create a simple reserve mission, copy your current cruise phase which is located in {glue:md}`mission_info`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You may need to revise some of your assumptions for the copied phase if you are making a reserve phase that is radically different than the original (i.e. original phase was to travel 3000km but reserve phase is 100km).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Append that phase to the end of {glue:md}`mission_info`, name it `reserve_cruise` and add `\"reserve\": True,` to `user_options` for this phase.\n",
    "There are two optional flags that can now be added to `user_options`.\n",
    "The `\"target_duration\"` option creates a phase requiring the aircraft to fly for a specific amount of time.\n",
    "The `\"target_distance\"` option creates a phase requiring the aircraft to fly for a specific distance.\n",
    "Avoid using the optional flag if you have a reserve phase (i.e climb or descent) where you just want that phase to be completed as quickly as possible.\n",
    "The optional flags should not be combined as they will create overlapping constraints creating an infeasible problem."

    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "When adding a reserve phase, {glue:md}`check_and_preprocess_inputs()` divides all the phases into two dictionaries: `regular_phases` which contain your nominal phases and `reserve_phases` which contains any phases with the `reserve` flag set to `True`.\n",
    "Additionally, {glue:md}`check_and_preprocess_inputs()` will add the `\"analytic\"` flag to each phase.\n",
    "This is used to indicate if a phase is an analytic phase (i.e. Breguet range) or a ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the final mission mass and range from `regular_phases` are automatically connected to the first point of the `reserve_phases`.\n",
    "All other state variables (i.e. altitude, mach) are not automatically connected, allowing you to start the reserve mission at whatever altitude you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\"analytic\"` flag helps to properly connect phases for {glue:md}`2DOF` missions.\n",
    "{glue:md}`2DOF` `cruise` missions are analytic because they use a Breguet range calculation instead of integrating an EOM. \n",
    "Analytic phases have a slightly different naming convention in order to access state/timeseries variables like distance, mass, and range compared with their non-analytic counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot create a reserve mission that enforces time or range constraints over multiple phases (i.e specify the total range covered by a climb + cruise + descent).\n",
    "This is because each constraint `\"target_distance\"` or `\"target_time\"` is only enforced on a single phase.\n",
    "It is essential that you run {glue:md}`prob.check_and_preprocess_inputs()` after {glue:md}`prob.load_inputs()` to make sure that regular and reserve phases are separated via `phase_separator()`."
