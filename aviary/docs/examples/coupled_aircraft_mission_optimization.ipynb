    "# Coupled Aircraft-Mission Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most exciting features of Aviary is the ability to formulate and solve coupled aircraft-mission design optimization problems.\n",
    "Here, we mean that we are finding the optimal aircraft design parameters while simultaneously finding the optimal mission trajectory.\n",
    "The reason why this is so valuable is that it enables exploration of a larger design space much more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving coupled design-mission problems leads to optimal designs that would not be findable without simultaneously designing the aircraft and the trajectory.\n",
    "This is especially useful for unconventional aircraft designs, operations with complex missions, and many more future-focused studies than what is commonly flying today.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doc page builds up a coupled design problem and explains what we're doing along the way.\n",
    "This process is relatively straightforward in Aviary.\n",
    "We will briefly discuss the optimal results, but that is not necessarily the focus here.\n",
    "Instead, we want to showcase how to do a simple coupled design study in Aviary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this as a starting point for your own exciting aircraft and mission design studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a conventional single-aisle commercial aircraft design as our starting point.\n",
    "For all of these examples we allow the aircraft to be sized by the optimizer.\n",
    "This means the gross takeoff weight is controlled to meet a mass balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform four different optimization cases as part of this study:\n",
    "\n",
    "- fixed mission profile, fixed aircraft wing aspect ratio\n",
    "- fixed mission profile, optimized aircraft wing aspect ratio\n",
    "- optimized mission profile, fixed aircraft wing aspect ratio\n",
    "- optimized mission profile, optimized aircraft wing aspect ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll provide more detail individually for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call Aviary, we will use a common `phase_info` object that we modify for each optimization case shown here:"
