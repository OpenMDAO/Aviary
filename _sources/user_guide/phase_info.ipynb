Users are free to choose any valid python name for their phases (valid characters are upper/lower case letters, numbers, and underscores.) In addition, there are two default phases \"pre_mission\" and \"post_mission\". These contain any settings that pertain to the pre_mission, which is any calculation that occurs before the mission runs, and the post_mission, which is any calculation that occurs after the mission runs.\n"

    "\n",
    "An overview of user options for a Height Energy phase is given in the [Level 1 Introduction](../getting_started/onboarding_level1.ipynb), and an example for a cruise phase is shown in the [Level 2 Introduction](../getting_started/onboarding_level2.ipynb). These are good starting points for understanding how these options are specified. The Aviary trajectory is constructed using phase builders. In general, each option is a name, value pair where the names are intended to follow a specific pattern. In particular, when the option name includes a variable name, that name goes first. For example, the initial and final values for constraints on altitude would be \"altitude_initial\" and \"altitude_final\". Each value could be a number, tuple/list, array, or a boolean as needed. The user options format supports (and enforces) the inclusion of an OpenMDAO unit string when specifying any quantity that has a unit. These take the format \"(500, 's')\". If an option requires units and takes multiple value, the format \"((300.0, 900.0), 's')\" is used.  Some unitless variables (such as Mach) can be specified as a single number, but the tuple format with \"unitless\" as the unit is also supported as a best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each builder has its own options that are tied to the equations of motion that it models. Thus, since the two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) equations have different states and controls than the height energy equations, the phase_infos have some user options that are different. The following section describes the general patterns that apply to the phases that are included in Aviary.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **{glue:md}`throttle_allocation`**: How to allocate throttles for multi-engine, can be \"fixed\" for user-specified allocations, \"static\" where the optimizer picks a single allocation for the whole phase, or \"dynamic\" where the optimizer chooses an allocation at each trajectory point.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **{glue:md}`ground_roll`**: When True, restrict the problem to the ground plane. This will remove certain states/controls, and is only used in takeoff and landing phases when using the 2DOF equations of motion.\n",

    "- **{glue:md}`mass_ref0`**: Additive scale factor \"ref0\" for mass. Default is None.\n",

    "- **{glue:md}`mass_constraint_ref`**: Multiplicative scale factor \"ref\" for boundary constraint. If unspecified, then the value in `mass_final` will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{glue:md}`mass_solve_segments`**: When True, a solver will be used to converge the mass collocation defects within a segment. Note that the state continuity defects between segements will still be handled by the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "In a height energy phase, the controls are mach and altitude. In a two degree of freedom phase, the controls are throttle or angle of attack depending on the phase. Here, the options for the \"altitude\" control are described.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{glue:md}`altitude_optimize`**: When True, the optimizer will set this value. When False, the initial value for all nodes can be set in the initial_conditions section of the phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{glue:md}`altitude_initial`**: Altitude at the start of the phase. If altitude_optimize is True, specifying this will create a constraint. Otherwise, it serves as an initial value for the first point. When unspecified, the linkage constraint with the upstream phase will drive this value if altitude_optimize is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{glue:md}`altitude_final`**: Altitude at the end of the phase. If altitude_optimize is True, specifying this will create a constraint. Otherwise, it serves as an initial value for the first point. When unspecified, the linkage constraint with the downstream phase will drive this value if altitude_optimize is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{glue:md}`altitude_bounds`**: Tuple of upper and lower bounds for all values of altitude in the phase. The default of None for either means that bound will not be declared.\n",
